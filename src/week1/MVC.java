Model-View-Controller
Is an architectural paradigm for programming

Model	(Data)
	- this is the data your program will use
	- divided into classes to make it easier to program
	- Data and methods used to work with it
	- when writing code that relates to the data section of the program, it goes in the model 
	
View	(UI)
	- this is what the user sees, the interface
	- these are the JFrame constructor
	- the forms and controls
	- the interface
	- outputting front-end visible code, that's the view
	
Controller	(Code) 
	- this is the code, the logic of the program 
	- this happens in functions and subroutines
	- coordinates interactions between the View and Model
	- when writing code that processes the data to/from database, or before it is displayed this is controller
	

Theory is
1. Define data first
2. then create UI
3. The start programming

Steps:

Step1: Design the classes
	- Create the UML diagram for the application
	- Each "thing" in your program becomes a class, e.g. Institution, Applicants, Courses, Fees
	- Each class is given its on attributes(variables) and methods
	

Step2: Create UI
	- When you know the data that is needed, you can design the screens you will need
	
	
Step3: Coding
	- Now you can knit the classes and the UI together
	- this is the programming part, and it comes last not first
	- Start by creating the classes, then create the UI and finally write the logic into the methods
